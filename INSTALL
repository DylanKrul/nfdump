Installation:
-------------
The tools should work on any *nix flavor. They have been compiled
and tested on Linux, Solaris (32/64bit), OpenBSD (32/64bit) as well
as MacOSX.

./configure
make
make install

should do the job.

configure options:
	--enable-64
	When using Snore CC on Solaris, you may compile 64 bit code. 
	default is NO

	--enable-ftconv 
	Build ft2nfdump converter. The flow-tools sources are required
	to build ft2nfdump.

	--with-ftpath[=flow-tools sources]
	When building ft2nfdump, configure expects to find the 
	flow-tools sources in ../flow-tools-0.67. In case of another 
	path, the flow-tools directory is specified.

The parser code produced by yacc or bison can generate some 
warnings, when being compiled.  These can safely be ignored.

On any Solaris, make sure you have flex installed, as lex
on Solaris does not compile the scanner properly.

Uninstalling:

make uninstall

Notes on compatibility:
nfdump 1.4 introduces milisecond resolution. This resulted in a small
change of the binary format of nfdump files. However, this change is
fully transparent to the user, which means, nfdump 1.4 is able to read 
and process older files, and nfdump < 1.4 is able to read and process
nfdump 1,4 files. But note: The milisecond resolution is only available
in data files captured with nfcapd v1.4 and processed with nfdump 1.4.
