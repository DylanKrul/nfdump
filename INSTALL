Installation:
-------------
The tools should work on any *nix flavor. They have been compiled
and tested on Linux, Solaris (32/64bit), OpenBSD (32/64bit) as well
as MacOSX.

./configure
make
make install

should do the job.

configure options:
	--enable-64
	When using Snore CC on Solaris, you may compile 64 bit code. 
	default is NO

The parser code produced by yacc or bison can generate some 
warnings, when being compiled.  These can safely be ignored.

Uninstalling:

make uninstall

Notes on compatibility:
v7 data files created by nfdump < 1.2 are not compatible with
nfdump 1.2. As this is a new project, it is not expected that
many people have large v7 data archives. Otherwise contact me
for conversion.
v5 data files created by nfdump < v 1.2 are fully supported.
