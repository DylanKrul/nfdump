Installation:
-------------
The tools should work on any *nix flavor. They have been compiled
and tested on Linux(32/64bit) AMD64, Solaris (32/64bit), 
OpenBSD (32/64bit) as well as MacOSX.

./configure
make
make install

should do the job.

configure options:
	--enable-compat14
	Build nfdump to read pre 1.5 data files. Use this option
	if you have data files nfdump <= 1.4.1

	--enable-nfprofile
	Build nfprofile used by NfSen

	--with-rrdpath=[/usr]
	When building nfprofile, configure expects to find the
	installed rrdtool in /usr with rrd.h in /usr/include and
	librrd in /usr/lib

	--enable-ftconv 
	Build ft2nfdump converter. The flow-tools sources are required
	to build ft2nfdump.

	--with-ftpath[=flow-tools sources]
	When building ft2nfdump, configure expects to find the 
	flow-tools sources in ../flow-tools-0.67. In case of another 
	path, the flow-tools directory is specified.

	--enable-64
	When using SUNWspro CC on Solaris, you may compile 64 bit code. 
	default is NO

	--enable-sflow
	Build sflow collector daemon.

The parser code produced by yacc or bison can generate some 
warnings, when being compiled.  These can safely be ignored.

Note on Solaris:
On any Solaris, make sure you have flex installed, as lex
on Solaris does not compile the scanner properly.
When using SUNWspro set CC environment variable and run
configure: 
setenv CC /opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc
./configure ...

Notes on compatibility:
As of nfdump 1.5, a new binary data format was introduced, to cope
with any kind of input data such as netflow v9 and sflow data. This 
new format is not readable by nfdump <= 1.4.1. nfdump 1.5 can read 
old style data files when compat14 mode is enabled. ( see configure 
options ), but will always create new style data files. The new 
binary format also integrates old style .stat files, which no 
longer exist.

Although, nfdump 1.5.x should smoothly replace nfdump <= 1.4.1

nfsen <= 1.2.1 does not work together with nfdump 1.5,
use at least nfsen > v1.2.3 instead.

Use CreateSubHierarchy.pl as described in the README file to move
existing nfcapd files into a new sub directory hierarchy.

Uninstalling:
-------------
make uninstall
