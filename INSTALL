Installation:
-------------
The tools should work on any *nix flavor. They have been compiled
and tested on Linux, Solaris (32/64bit), OpenBSD (32/64bit) as well
as MacOSX.

./configure
make
make install

should do the job.

configure options:
	--enable-64bit
	When using SunPro CC on Solaris, you may compile 64 bit code. 
	default is NO

The parser code produced by yacc or bison can generate some 
warnings, when being compiled.  They can safely be ignored.

Uninstalling:

make uninstall
