Installation:
-------------
The tools should work on any *nix flavor. They have been compiled
and tested on Linux, Solaris (32/64bit), OpenBSD (32/64bit) as well
as MacOSX.

./configure
make
make install

should do the job.

configure options:
	--enable-64
	When using Snore CC on Solaris, you may compile 64 bit code. 
	default is NO

	--enable-ftconv 
	Build ft2nfdump converter. The flow-tools sources are required
	to build ft2nfdump.

	--with-ftpath[=flow-tools sources]
	When building ft2nfdump, configure expects to find the 
	flow-tools sources in ../flow-tools-0.67. In case of another 
	path, the flow-tools directory is specified.

The parser code produced by yacc or bison can generate some 
warnings, when being compiled.  These can safely be ignored.

Uninstalling:

make uninstall

Notes on compatibility:
v7 data files created by nfdump < 1.2 are not compatible with
nfdump version >= 1.2. However, it is not expected that
many people have large old v7 data archives. Otherwise contact me
for conversion.
v5 data files created by nfdump < v 1.2 are fully supported.
