.SH NAME
nfdump \- netflow display and analyze program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP 5
.B nfdump [options] [filter]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B nfdump
is the netflow display and analyzing program of the nfdump tool set. 
It reads the netflow data from files stored by nfcapd and processes
the flows according the options given. The filter syntax is comparable 
to tcpdump and extended for netflow data. Nfdump can also display many 
different top N flow and flow element statistics.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 3
.B -r \fIinputfile
Read input data from \fIinputfile\fR. Default is read from stdin.
.TP 3
.B -R \fIexpr
Read input from a sequence of concatenated files. The \fIexpr\fR
may be one of:
.PD 0
.RS 4
/any/\fIdir\fR          Read all files in directory \fIdir\fR.
.P
/dir/\fIfile\fR         Read all files beginning with \fIfile\fR.
.P
/dir/\fIfile1:file2\fR  Read all files from \fIfile1\fR to \fIfile2\fR.
.RE
.PD
.TP 3
.B -M \fIexpr
Read input from multiple directories. The \fIexpr\fR looks like:
\fI/any/path/to/dir1:dir2:dir3\fR etc. and will be expanded to the
directories: \fI/any/path/to/dir1\fR, \fI/any/path/to/dir2\fR and 
\fI/any/path/to/dir3\fR Any number of colon separated directories may 
be given. The files to read are specified by -r or -R and are expected 
to exist in all the given directories.  The options -r and -R must 
not contain any directory part when used in conjunction with -M.
.TP 3
.B -m
Sort the netflow records according the date first seen. This option is
usually only useful in conjunction with -M, when netflow records are 
read from different sources, which are not necessarily sorted.
.TP 3
.B -w \fIoutputfile
If specified writes binary netflow records to \fIoutputfile\fR ready
to be processed again with nfdump. The default output is ASCII on
stdout.
.TP 3
.B -f \fIfilterfile
Reads the filter syntax from \fIfilterfile\fR. Note: Any filter specified
directly on the command line takes precedence over -f.
.TP 3
.B -t \fItimewin
Process only flows, which fall in the time window \fItimewin\fR, where
\fItimewin\fR is YYYY/MM/dd.hh:mm:ss[-YYYY/MM/dd.hh:mm:ss]. Any parts of
the time spec may be omitted e.g YYYY/MM/dd expands to 
YYYY/MM/dd.00:00:00-YYYY/MM/dd.23:59:59 and processes all flow from a 
given day. The time window may also be specified as +/- n. In this case
it is relative to the beginning or end of all flows. +10 means the first
10 seconds of all flows, -10 means the last 10 seconds of all flows.
.TP 3
.B -c \fInum
Limit number of records to process to the first \fInum\fR flows.
.TP 3
.B -a
Aggregate netflow data. Aggregation is done at connection level.
.TP 3
.B -A \fIfields
Aggregate netflow data using the specified fields, where fields is a ',' 
separated list out of \fIsrcip dstip srcport dstport\fR. The default is using
all fields: \fIsrcip,dstip,srcport,dstport\fR. Only flows of the same protocol
are aggregated.
.TP 3
.B -S
Compatibility option with pre 1.4 nfdump. Is equal to \fI-s record/packets/bytes\fR.
.TP 3
.B -s \fIstatistic[/orderby]
Generate the Top N flow or flow element statistic. \fIstatistic\fR can be:
.PD 0
.RS 5
record  Statistic about aggregated netflow records.
.P
srcip   Statistic about source IP addresses
.P
dstip   Statistic about destination IP addresses
.P
ip      Statistic about any (source or destination) IP addresses
.P
srcport Statistic about source ports
.P
dstport Statistic about destination ports
.P

.P
srcas   Statistic about source AS numbers
.P
dstas   Statistic about destination AS numbers
.P
as      Statistic about any (source or destination) AS numbers
.P
.RE
.RS 3
.P
\fIorderby\fR is optional and specifies the order by which the statistics is
ordered and can be \fIflows\fR, \fIpackets\fR, \fIbytes\fR, \fIpps\fR, \fIbps\fR 
or \fIbpp\fR. You may specify more than one \fIorderby\fR which results in the 
same statistic but ordered differently. If no \fIorderby\fR is given, statistics 
are ordered by \fIflows\fR.
You can specify as many -s flow element statistics on the command line for the 
same run. 
.P
Example: -s srcip -s ip/flows -s dstport/pps/packets/bytes -s record/bytes
.RE
.PD
.TP 3
.B -O \fIorderby
Specifies the default \fIorderby\fR for flow element statistics -s, which 
applies when no \fIorderby\fR is given at -s. \fIorderby\fR can be \fIflows\fR, 
\fIpackets\fR, \fIbytes\fR, \fIpps\fR, \fIbps\fR or \fIbpp\fR. Defaults to \fIflows\fR.
.TP 3
.B -l \fI[+/-]packet_num
Limit statistics output to those records above or below the \fIpacket_num\fR 
limit. \fIpacket_num\fR accepts positive or negative numbers followed by 'K'
, 'M' or 'G' 10E3, 10E6 or 10E9 flows respectively. See also note at -L
.TP 3
.B -L \fI[+/-]byte_num
Limit statistics output to those records above or below the \fIbyte_num\fR 
limit. \fIbyte_num\fR accepts positive or negative numbers followed by 'K'
, 'M' or 'G' 10E3, 10E6 or 10E9 bytes respectively. \fINote:\fR These limits only
apply to the statistics and aggregated outputs generated with -a -s or -S.
To filter netflow records by packets and bytes, use the filter syntax 'packets'
and 'bytes' described below.
.TP 3
.B -n \fInum
Define the number for the Top N statistics. Defaults to 10. If 0 is specified
the number is unlimited.
.TP 3
.B -o \fIformat
Selects the output format to print flows or flow statistics (-S). The following 
formats are available:
.PD 0
.RS 5
raw      Print each flow on multiple lines.
.P
line     Print each flow on one line. Default format.
.P

Prefix-preserving Anonymization) module. The key is used to 
initialize the Rijndael cipher. \fIkey\fR is either a 32 character 
string, or a 64 hex digit string starting with 0x. Anonymizing takes
place \fIafter\fR applying the flow filter, but before printing the flow
or writing the flow to a file.

.SH "OUTPUT FORMATS"
The output format \fBraw\fR prints each flow record on multiple lines, including
all information available in the record. This is the most detailed view on a 
flow. Use this output format, if you are interested in the details of flows, not
printed in the other output formats.
.P
The output format \fBline\fR is the default output format when no format is specified.
It prints the flow record each on a single line and limits the information to the
connection details as well as number of packets, bytes and flows.
.P
The output format \fBlong\fR is identical to the format \fBline\fR, and includes
additional information such as TCP flags and Type of Service.
.P
The output format \fBextended\fR is identical to the format \fBlong\fR, and includes
additional computed information such as \fBpps\fR, \fBbps\fR and \fBbpp\fR.
.P
\fIFields:\fR
.P
.RS 3
\fBDate flow start:\fR Start time flow first seen. ISO 8601 format 
including milliseconds.
.P
\fBDuration:\fR Duration of the flow in seconds and milliseconds. 
If flows are aggregated, \fIduration\fR is the time span over the 
entire period of time from first seen to last seen.
.P
\fBProto:\fR Protocol used in the connection.
.P
\fBSrc IP Addr:Port:\fR Source IP address and source port.
.P
\fBDst IP Addr:Port:\fR Destination IP address and destination port.
.P
\fBFlags:\fR TCP flags ORed of the connection.
.P
\fBTos:\fR Type of service.
.P
\fBPackets:\fR The number of packets in this flow. If flows are 
aggregated, the packets are summed up. 
.P
\fBBytes:\fR The number of bytes in this flow. If flows are aggregated, 
the bytes are summed up.
.P
\fBpps:\fR The calculated packets per second: number of packets / duration. 
If flows are aggregated this results in the average pps during this period of time.
.P
\fBbps:\fR The calculated bits per second: 8 * number of bytes / duration. If flows
are aggregated this results in the average bps during this period of time.
.P
\fBBpp:\fR The calculated bytes per packet: number of bytes / number of packets. If flows
are aggregated this results in the average bpp during this period of time.
.P
\fBFlows:\fR Number of flows. If flows are listed only, this number is always 1. If flows
are aggregated, this shows the number of aggregated flows to one record.
.P
Numbers larger than 1048576 (1024*1024), are scaled to 4 digits and one decimal digit including the
scaling factor \fBM\fR, \fBG\fR or \fBT\fR for cleaner output, e.g. \fB923.4 M\fR

.SH "FILTER
"
The filter syntax is similar to the well known pcap library used by tcpdump.
The filter can be either specified on the command line after all options or 
in a separate file. It can span several lines. Anything after a '#' is treated as a 
comment and ignored to the end of the line. There is virtually no limit in 
the length of the filter expression. All keywords are case independent.
.P Syntax
Any filter consists of one or more expressions \fIexpr\fR. Any number of \fIexpr\fR
can be linked together:
.P
expr \fBand\fR expr, expr \fBor\fR expr, \fBnot\fR expr and \fB(\fR expr \fB)\fR.
.P
\fIExpr\fR can be one of the following filter primitives:
.TP 4
.I protocol
\fBTCP, UDP, ICMP, GRE, ESP, AH, RSVP\fR or \fBPROTO\fR \fInum\fR where \fInum\fR is the protocol 
number.
.TP 4
.I IP address
.PD 0
.RS 4
\fB[SourceDestination]\fR \fBIP\fR \fIa.b.c.d\fR or
.P
\fB[SourceDestination]\fR \fBHOST\fR \fIa.b.c.d\fR with \fIa.b.c.d\fR as any valid IP address.
\fISourceDestination\fR may be omitted.
.RE
.PD
.TP 4
.I SourceDestination
defines the IP address to be selected and can be \fBSRC\fR 
\fBDST\fR or any combination of \fBSRC and|or DST\fR. Omitting \fISourceDestination\fR is

.SH NOTES
Generating the statistics for data files of a few hundred MB is no problem. However
be careful if you want to create statistics of several GB of data. This may consume a lot
of memory and can take a while. Also, anonymizing IP addresses is time consuming and uses
a lot of CPU power, which reduces the number of flows per second. Therefore anonymizing
takes place only, when flow records are printed or written to files. Any internal flow
processing takes place using the original IP addresses.
