.SH NAME
nfcapd \- netflow capture daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP 5
.B nfcapd [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B nfcapd
is the netflow capture daemon of the nfdump tools. It reads netflow
data from the network and stores it into files. The output file
is automatically rotated and renamed every n minutes - typically
5 min - according the timestamp YYYYMMddhhmm of the interval e.g. 
nfcapd.200407110845 contains the data from July 11th 2004 08:45 onward.
Additionally a file named nfcapd.200407110845.stat is created which
contains an ASCII readable statistical summary of the data. At the 
end of every interval you may run any external programm, for example
nfprofile, which allows you to process the data.
.P
Netflow version v5 and v7 are transparently supported.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 3
.B -p \fIportnum
Specifies the port number to listen. Default port is 9995
.TP 3
.B -b \fIIPaddr
Specifies the IP address to bind for listening. Default is any
available IPv4 interface.
.TP 3
.B -l \fIdirectory
Specifies the directory to store the output files. Default is /var/tmp
.TP 3
.B -t \fIinterval
Specifies the time interval in seconds to rotate files. The default value 
is 300s ( 5min ).
.TP 3
.B -w
Align file rotation with next n minute ( specified by -t ) interval. 
Example: If interval is 5 min, sync at 0,5,10... wall clock minutes 
Default: no alignment.
.TP 3
.B -x \fIcmd
Run command \fIcmd\fR at the end of every interval, when a new file
becomes available. The following command expansion is available:
.PD 0
.RS 4
%f	Replaced by the file name e.g nfcapd.200407110845.
.P
%d	Replaced by the directory where the file is located.
.P
%t	Replaced by the time ISO format e.g. 200407110845.
.P
%u	Replaced by the UNIX time format.
.P
%i	Replaced ident string given by -I
.RE
.PD
.TP 3
.B -P \fIpidfile
Specify name of pidfile. Default is no pidfile.
.TP 3
.B -D
Daemon mode: fork to background and detach from terminal.
Nfcapd terminates on signal TERM, INT and HUP.
.TP 3
.B -I \fIIdentString
Specifies an ident string, which describes the source e.g. the 
name of the router. This string is put into the stat file to identify
the source. Default is 'none'.
.TP 3
.B -B \fIbufflen
Specifies the socket input buffer length in bytes. For high volume traffic 
( near GB traffic ) it is recommended to set this value as high as possible 
( typically > 100k ), otherwise you risk to lose packets. The default 
is OS ( and kernel )  dependent.
.TP 3
.B -E
Print netflow records in nfdump raw format to stdout. This option is for 
debugging purpose only, to see how incoming netflow data is processed and stored.
.TP 3
.B -V
Print nfcapd version and exit.
.TP 3
.B -h
Print help text to stdout with all options and exit.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns 0 on success, or 255 if initialization failed.
.SH "LOGGING"
nfcapd logs to syslog with SYSLOG_FACILITY LOG_DAEMON
For normal operation level 'warning' should be fine. 
More information is reported at level 'info' and 'debug'.
.P
A small statistic about the collected flows, as well as errors
are reported at the end of every interval to syslog with level 'info'.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
nfcapd -w -D -l /netflow/spool/router1 -p 23456 -B 128000 -I router1 -x '/path/nfprofile -p /to/profile/dir -s router1 -r %d/%f'  -P /var/run/nfcapd/nfcapd.router1
.SH NOTES
Setting the socket buffer size is system dependent. When starting up, 
nfcapd returns the number of bytes the buffer was actually set. This 
is done by reading back the buffer size and may differ from what you
requested. 
.P
Nfdump tools version 1.4 support netflow v5 and v7 transparently.

I only found the second last bug. Please report the last one back to me.
