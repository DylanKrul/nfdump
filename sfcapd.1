.SH NAME
sfcapd \- sflow capture daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP 5
.B sfcapd [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sfcapd
is the sflow capture daemon of the nfdump tools. It reads sflow
data from the network and stores it into nfcapd compatible files. 
The output file is automatically rotated and renamed every n 
minutes - typically 5 min - according the timestamp YYYYMMddhhmm 
of the interval e.g. nfcapd.200407110845 contains the data from 
July 11th 2004 08:45 onward. sfcapd supports sFlow version 4 and 
5 datagrams.
.P
Sflow is an industry standard developed by InMon Corporation.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 3
.B -p \fIportnum
Specifies the port number to listen. Default port is 6343
.TP 3
.B -b \fIbindhost
Specifies the hostname/IPv4/IPv6 address to bind for listening. Can be an IP
address or a hostname, resolving to an IP address attached to an interface.
Defaults to any available IPv4 interface, if not specified.
.TP 3
.B -4
Forces sfcapd to listen on IPv4 addresses only. Can be used together with -b
if a hostname has an IPv4 and IPv6 address record.
.TP 3
.B -6
Forces sfcapd to listen on IPv6 addresses only. Can be used together with -b
if a hostname has an IPv4 and IPv6 address record.
.TP 3
.B -j \fIMulticastGroup
Join the specified IPv6 or IPv6 multicast group for listening. 
.TP 3
.B -R \fIhost[/port}
Enable packet repeater. Send all incoming packets to another \fIhost\fR and \fIport\fR.
\fIhost\fR is either a valid IPv4/IPv6 address, or a valid simbolic hostname, which resolves to 
a IPv6 or IPv4 address. \fIport\fR may be ommited and defaults to port 6343. Note: Due to IPv4/IPv6
accepted addresses the port separator is '/'.
.TP 3
.B -l \fIbase_directory
Specifies the base directory to store the output files. Default is /var/tmp
If a sub hierarchy is specified with -S the final directory is concatenated 
to \fIbase_directory/sub_hierarchy
.TP 3
.B -S \fI<num>
Allows to specify an additional directory sub hierarchy to store 
the data files. The default is 0, no sub hierarchy, which means the 
files go directly in the base directory (-l). The base directory (-l) is
concatenated with the specified sub hierarchy format to form the final 
data directory.  The following hierarchies are defined:
.PD 0
.RS 4
 0 default     no hierachy levels
.P
 1 %Y/%m/%d    year/month/day
.P
 2 %Y/%m/%d/%H year/month/day/hour
.P
 3 %Y/%W/%u    year/week_of_year/day_of_week
.P
 4 %Y/%W/%u/%H year/week_of_year/day_of_week/hour
.P
 5 %Y/%W/%u    year/week_of_year/day_of_week
.P
 6 %Y/%W/%u/%H year/week_of_year/day_of_week/hour
.P
 7 %Y/%j       year/day-of-year
.P
 8 %Y/%j/%H    year/day-of-year/hour
.P
 9 %Y-%m-%d    year-month-day
.P
10 %Y-%m-%d/%H year-month-day/hour
.RE
.PD
.TP 3
.B -t \fIinterval
Specifies the time interval in seconds to rotate files. The default value 
is 300s ( 5min ).
.TP 3
.B -w
Align file rotation with next n minute ( specified by -t ) interval. 
Example: If interval is 5 min, sync at 0,5,10... wall clock minutes 
Default: no alignment.
.TP 3
.B -x \fIcmd
Run command \fIcmd\fR at the end of every interval, when a new file
becomes available. The following command expansion is available:
.PD 0
.RS 4
%f	Replaced by the file name e.g nfcapd.200407110845 inluding any
.P
     sub hierachy. ( 2004/07/11/nfcapd.200407110845 )
.P
%d	Replaced by the directory where the file is located.
.P
%t	Replaced by the time ISO format e.g. 200407110845.
.P
%u	Replaced by the UNIX time format.
.P
%i	Replaced ident string given by -I
.RE
.PD
.TP 3
.B -e 
Auto expire files at every cycle. \fImax lifetime\fP and \fImax filesize\fP
are defined using nfexpire(1)
.TP 3
.B -P \fIpidfile
Specify name of pidfile. Default is no pidfile.
.TP 3
.B -D
Daemon mode: fork to background and detach from terminal.
Nfcapd terminates on signal TERM, INT and HUP.
.TP 3
.B -u \fIuserid
Change to the user \fIuserid\fP as soon as possible. Only root is allowed
to use this option.
.TP 3
.B -g \fIgroupid
Change to the group \fIgroupid\fP as soon as possible. Only root is allowed 
use this option.
.TP 3
.B -I \fIIdentString
Specifies an ident string, which describes the source e.g. the 
name of the router. This string is put into the stat record to identify
the source. Default is 'none'.
.TP 3
.B -B \fIbufflen
Specifies the socket input buffer length in bytes. For high volume traffic 
( near GB traffic ) it is recommended to set this value as high as possible 
( typically > 100k ), otherwise you risk to lose packets. The default 
is OS ( and kernel )  dependent.
.TP 3
.B -E
Print data records in nfdump raw format to stdout. This option is for 
debugging purpose only, to see how incoming sflow data is processed and stored.
.TP 3
.B -V
Print sfcapd version and exit.
.TP 3
.B -h
Print help text to stdout with all options and exit.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns 0 on success, or 255 if initialization failed.
.SH "LOGGING"
sfcapd logs to syslog with SYSLOG_FACILITY LOG_DAEMON
For normal operation level 'warning' should be fine. 
More information is reported at level 'info' and 'debug'.
.P
A small statistic about the collected flows, as well as errors
are reported at the end of every interval to syslog with level 'info'.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
sfcapd -w -D -l /data/spool/router1 -p 6343 -B 128000 -I router1 -x '/path/nfprofile -p /to/profile/dir -s router1 -r %d/%f'  -P /var/run/sfcapd/sfcapd.router1
.SH NOTES
sfcapd automatically scales the packets and bytes according the sampling rate.
.P
Even with sflow version 4 and 5 support, not all available sflow elements 
are stored in the data files. As of this version, sfcpad supports the the same
fields, as it's netflow companion nfcapd for netflow version v9. See nfcapd(1).
More fields will be supported in future.
.P
The format of the data files is version independant and compatible nfcapd collected data.
.P
Socket buffer: Setting the socket buffer size is system dependent. 
When starting up, sfcapd returns the number of bytes the buffer was 
actually set. This is done by reading back the buffer size and may 
differ from what you requested.
