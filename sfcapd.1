.SH NAME
sfcapd \- sflow capture daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP 5
.B sfcapd [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sfcapd
is the sflow capture daemon of the nfdump tools. It reads sflow
data from the network and stores it into nfcapd compatible files. 
The output file is automatically rotated and renamed every n 
minutes - typically 5 min - according the timestamp YYYYMMddhhmm 
of the interval e.g. nfcapd.200407110845 contains the data from 
July 11th 2004 08:45 onward. sfcapd supports sFlow version 4 and 
5 datagrams.
.P
Sflow is an industry standard developed by InMon Corporation.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 3
.B -p \fIportnum
Specifies the port number to listen. Default port is 6343
.TP 3
.B -b \fIbindhost
Specifies the hostname/IPv4/IPv6 address to bind for listening. Can be an IP
address or a hostname, resolving to an IP address attached to an interface.
Defaults to any available IPv4 interface, if not specified.
.TP 3
.B -4
Forces sfcapd to listen on IPv4 addresses only. Can be used together with -b
if a hostname has an IPv4 and IPv6 address record.
.TP 3
.B -6
Forces sfcapd to listen on IPv6 addresses only. Can be used together with -b
if a hostname has an IPv4 and IPv6 address record.
.TP 3
.B -j \fIMulticastGroup
Join the specified IPv6 or IPv6 multicast group for listening. 
.TP 3
.B -l \fIdirectory
Specifies the directory to store the output files. Default is /var/tmp
.TP 3
.B -t \fIinterval
Specifies the time interval in seconds to rotate files. The default value 
is 300s ( 5min ).
.TP 3
.B -w
Align file rotation with next n minute ( specified by -t ) interval. 
Example: If interval is 5 min, sync at 0,5,10... wall clock minutes 
Default: no alignment.
.TP 3
.B -x \fIcmd
Run command \fIcmd\fR at the end of every interval, when a new file
becomes available. The following command expansion is available:
.PD 0
.RS 4
%f	Replaced by the file name e.g nfcapd.200407110845.
.P
%d	Replaced by the directory where the file is located.
.P
%t	Replaced by the time ISO format e.g. 200407110845.
.P
%u	Replaced by the UNIX time format.
.P
%i	Replaced ident string given by -I
.RE
.PD
.TP 3
.B -P \fIpidfile
Specify name of pidfile. Default is no pidfile.
.TP 3
.B -D
Daemon mode: fork to background and detach from terminal.
Nfcapd terminates on signal TERM, INT and HUP.
.TP 3
.B -I \fIIdentString
Specifies an ident string, which describes the source e.g. the 
name of the router. This string is put into the stat file to identify
the source. Default is 'none'.
.TP 3
.B -B \fIbufflen
Specifies the socket input buffer length in bytes. For high volume traffic 
( near GB traffic ) it is recommended to set this value as high as possible 
( typically > 100k ), otherwise you risk to lose packets. The default 
is OS ( and kernel )  dependent.
.TP 3
.B -E
Print data records in nfdump raw format to stdout. This option is for 
debugging purpose only, to see how incoming sflow data is processed and stored.
.TP 3
.B -V
Print sfcapd version and exit.
.TP 3
.B -h
Print help text to stdout with all options and exit.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns 0 on success, or 255 if initialization failed.
.SH "LOGGING"
sfcapd logs to syslog with SYSLOG_FACILITY LOG_DAEMON
For normal operation level 'warning' should be fine. 
More information is reported at level 'info' and 'debug'.
.P
A small statistic about the collected flows, as well as errors
are reported at the end of every interval to syslog with level 'info'.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
sfcapd -w -D -l /data/spool/router1 -p 6343 -B 128000 -I router1 -x '/path/nfprofile -p /to/profile/dir -s router1 -r %d/%f'  -P /var/run/sfcapd/sfcapd.router1
.SH NOTES
sfcapd automatically scales the packets and bytes according the sampling rate.
.P
Even if sflow version 4 and 5 are supported, not all sflow available elements 
are stored in the data files. As of this version, sfcpad supports the the same
fields, as it's netflow companion nfcapd for netflow version v9. See nfcapd(1).
More fields will be supported in future.
.P
The format of the data files is version independant and compatible nfcapd collected data.
.P
Socket buffer: Setting the socket buffer size is system dependent. 
When starting up, sfcapd returns the number of bytes the buffer was 
actually set. This is done by reading back the buffer size and may 
differ from what you requested.
